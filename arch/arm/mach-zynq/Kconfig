config ZYNQ_EARLY_UART1
	tristate "Early Printk On UART1 (2nd UART)"
	default n
	help
	  Select if you want to use the 2nd UART (UART1) in Zynq for the early
	  printk. If not selected, the 1st UART (UART0) is used.

config ZYNQ_EARLY_UART_EP107
	tristate "Early UART Clock Input For EP107"
	default y
	help
	  Select if you want the kernel to be setup for the EP107 board which is
	  using a 50 MHz clock into the UART. Not selecting this causes a clock into
	  the UART that is based on a 33.333 MHz clock divided down by 63.  Note that
	  this only affects early printk.

config XILINX_FIXED_DEVTREE_ADDR
	tristate "Device Tree At Fixed Address"
	default y
	depends on OF
	help
	  Select if you want the kernel to assume a device tree is located at a
	  fixed address of 0x1000000 on kernel boot.  This allows the go command
	  in u-boot to be used since the bootm command is slow in the EP107.

config XILINX_L1_PREFETCH
	tristate "L1 Cache Prefetch"
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on L1 cache prefetching to get the best performance
	  in many cases. This may not always be the best performance depending on
	  the usage. There are some cases where this may cause issues when booting.

config XILINX_L2_PREFETCH
	tristate "L2 Cache Prefetch"
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on L2 cache prefetching to get the best performance
	  in many cases. This may not always be the best performance depending on
	  the usage.

config XILINX_TEST
	bool "Testing On Kernel Boot"
	default n
	help
	  Select if you want kernel tests to run on boot.  The tests may take
	  several minutes on kernel boot.

config ZYNQ_DEFAULT_KERNEL
	bool "Run the kernel as normal"
	help
	  Select if you want a normal kernel.

config ZYNQ_AMP_CPU0_MASTER
	bool "Run the Kernel For AMP on CPU0"
	help
	  Select if you want to run the kernel on CPU0 while also running
	  another kernel on CPU1 as a slave with respect to interrupt management.
	  This causes the kernel to push the 2nd set of device interrupts
	  to CPU1 so that it has it's own system.

config ZYNQ_AMP_CPU1_SLAVE
	bool "Run the Kernel For AMP on CPU1"
	help
	  Select if you want to run the kernel on CPU1 while also running
	  another kernel on CPU0 as a master with respect to interrupt management.
	  This causes the kernel to not touch the GIC distributor when it initializes
	  as CPU0 takes care of it.

config ZYNQ_CPU1_TEST
	bool "Run the Kernel On CPU1 For Testing"
	help
	  Select if you want to run the kernel on CPU1 without running a kernel on
	  CPU0 which is really only useful for testing purposes.  The really only
	  causes interrupts in the GIC to be on CPU1 rather than CPU0.
